# Web-PenTest-Checklist

## Cookie Settings

- Insecure transmission: Ensure cookies are sent only over HTTPS connections, to prevent interception by attackers. Set the "Secure" attribute for all cookies.

- Missing HttpOnly attribute: Set the "HttpOnly" attribute to ensure cookies are inaccessible to client-side scripts, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
